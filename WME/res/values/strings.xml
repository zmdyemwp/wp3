    <string name="faq_question5">5. How do I start breathing exercises?</string>
    <string name="faq_question6">6. What is the most effective way to do rhythmic breathing?</string>
    <string name="faq_question7">7. What is the importance of rhythmic breathing and what\'s in it for me?</string>
    <string name="faq_question8">8. What is HRV?</string>
    <string name="faq_question9">9. What is Autonomic Nervous System(ANS)?</string>
    <string name="faq_question1_answer">W/Me can measure your physical and mental state on the go.\r\nW/Me digitally measures your heart rate variability (HRV). with our algorithm it can infer your Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) agility.\r\n\r\nW/Me can:\r\nMeasure emotional susceptibility\r\nMeasure ANS agility\r\nCoach rhythmic breathing exercises\r\nLocate your phone\r\nCheck in on facebook\r\nRemote camera trigger\r\nGmail alert\r\nDevice out of range alert</string>
    <string name="faq_question2_answer">The agility score represents the correlation between the heart rate variation and body stability. The higher the score, the more resilient you are to stress. Lower scores may correlate to weaker immune system and higher susceptibility to stress.</string>
    <string name="faq_question3_answer">Similar to general health exams, using W/Me on a regular basis provides personal preventative care. The importance of regular maintenance and understanding your health ensures quality of life as well as reduces the cost of healthcare.\r\nThe body shifts dynamically through different states, close monitoring gives you the ability to make informed decisions for your lifestyle.\r\nThe medical industry uses HRV as a baseline measurement for a persons vitality. It is used as an indicator to measure a persons physical and mental state. HRV reflects our adaptability to stress. HRV is also a index used for biological aging.</string>
    <string name="faq_question4_answer">In order to get an accurate representation of  the frequency spectrum, W&#047;Me takes approximately 3 minutes to collect data using the life spectrum analyzer. It is a lot more complicated than simple measurements like the heart\'s beats per minute (BPM).</string>
    <string name="faq_question5_answer">Four Steps for Rhythmic Breathing\r\n(1). Location:\r\nFind a comfortable environment and launch the app.\r\n(2). Posture:\r\n Posture is the foundation of maximizing your rhythmic breathing routine. You can be practice it while sitting or standing. The most important thing is to make sure your spine is straight and raise your head.\r\n(3). Relax:\r\nRelax your body, starting from the top; release your muscles from your eyebrows, neck, shoulders , arms, hands, legs and down to your toes.\r\nConcentrate on the flow of air entering and exiting your body.\r\nControl your inhale and exhale intervals by referring to the coaching app.\r\nwhen you get into the swing of it, your body will begin to relax, your body is starting to de-stress\r\n(4). Coaching\r\nFollow the rhythm in our coaching app. breath in slowly and exhale slowly. The LSA can detect whether or not you have completed the cycle per our guidance. Don\'t forget to use your abdomen!! Concentrate on the air flowing out from your body.</string>
    <string name="faq_question6_answer">Abdominal breathing is an effective way to stimulate the relaxation response to reduce stress and bring the body into a harmonic state. Your day to day energy level may be increased if you practice abdominal breathing techniques on a regular basis, try doing it with our app. Abdominal breathing is done by breathing as if you were inhaling from your abdominal area. Try to inhale by expansion of your abdominal muscles. Exhale by contracting your abdominal muscles.</string>
    <string name="faq_question7_answer">The autonomic nervous system controls the involuntary functions of the body, including breathing. Breathing is one of the few involuntary functions that can be controlled consciously. Rhythmic breathing is the first step to balance your body\'s inner workings Rhythmic breathing can facilitate a more harmonic heart rhythm.</string>
    <string name="faq_question8_answer">Heart rate variability (HRV) is the physiological phenomenon of variation in the time interval between heartbeats. It is measured by the variation in the beat-to-beat interval. Based on years of medical research and complex algorithms, a lot of information can be deduced from the heart rate variation. W/Me, lets you know how you are doing physically and emotionally.</string>
    <string name="faq_question9_answer">The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) controls the majority of our involuntary physical activities; heartbeat, blood pressure, body temperature, breathing and gastrointestinal motility. The ANS is located in the are of the brain called, medulla oblongata. It is the primary issue of preventative medicine to maintain the functionalities of ANS. The ANS is generally divided into two systems. the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system.</string>

    <!-- Suggestion String -->
    <string name="suggestion_ans_end">\r\nYour autonomic nervous system (ANS) age is based on your heart rate variability (HRV). Your ANS age is determined by taking your HRV and matching it with the average HRV of an age group in our database; this age group is your ANS age. It is essentially the age group of others that have the same average HRV. You may have an ANS age that is older than your actual age because of anxiety, hypertension, digestive disturbances, overloading, outside pressure, illness, depression, and so on.</string>
    <string name="suggestion_bpm">"Heart rate is the number of heart beats per unit of time, typically expressed in beats per minute (BPM). It reflects your overall heart and lung condition. Normal adult heart rates range from 60 to 100 BPM. An average heart rate is about 72 BPM. Heart rates below 60 BPM are common amongst athletes."</string>
